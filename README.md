# Elaboration Report: Scalable Property Management System

This repository contains the end-to-end design and planning documentation for a **scalable, maintainable, and robust property management system**. This project demonstrates a foundational understanding of the software development lifecycle, with a specific focus on creating a well-architected solution for **lease and tenant management**.

The documentation includes key artifacts from the elaboration phase, all designed to ensure successful delivery on time and within scope:

* **Functional & Non-functional Requirements:** Comprehensive definitions for a system supporting key features like **lease data tracking**, **tenant communication**, and **property maintenance requests**.
* **User Stories:** Detailed accounts of stakeholder needs, focusing on usability for property managers and tenants.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** A structured plan outlining all tasks required for the project, demonstrating an ability to manage and deliver a project effectively.
* **UML Diagrams:**
    * **Use Case Diagram:** Visual representation of how users interact with the system.
    * **Sequence Diagram:** Illustrates the flow of data and interactions between system components.
* **Project Management Artifacts:**
    * **Risk & Issue Log:** Identification and mitigation strategies for potential project roadblocks.
    * **Decision Log:** Records all key decisions made during the **solution design** phase.

This project showcases a proactive approach to project management and an emphasis on detailed, organized planningâ€”essential skills for a Healthcare Data Specialist and any role involving **documentation** and system implementation.
